Q1: Implementing a Double Hashed Table
Answer: This problem involves inserting two new key-value pairs into a partially populated double hash table using the provided hash functions, resolving collisions as necessary.
We're given a double hash function and a partially populated hash table.  We need to insert two new key-value pairs: (0, "Plum") and (9, "Strawberry").
1.	hash1(key) = key % 11: This gives the initial index.
2.	hash2(key) = 7 - (key % 7): This is used for collision resolution. If “hash1” produces a collision (occupied index), we use “hash2” to probe linearly.
Insert (0, "Plum"):
1.	“hash1(0) = 0 % 11 = 0”. Index 0 is already occupied.
2.	“hash2(0) = 7 - (0 % 7) = 7”. Index 7 is empty, so we place ("Plum", 0) at index 7.
Insert (9, "Strawberry"):
1.	“hash1(9) = 9 % 11 = 9”. Index 9 is occupied.
2.	“hash2(9) = 7 - (9 % 7) = 7 - 2 = 5”. Index 5 is occupied.
3.	We continue probing linearly using “hash2”: (5 + hash2(9)) % 11 = (5 + 5) % 11 = 10 % 11 = 10. Index 10 is empty, so we place ("Strawberry", 9) at index 10.

Q2: Representing a Graph Using a Matrix
Answer: This problem requires representing a given graph using an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list, and then identifying all cycles within the graph.
The provided graph shows 5 nodes.
Adjacency Matrix:  An adjacency matrix is a square matrix where the element at row i and column j represents the connection between node i and node j.  A '1' indicates a connection, and a '0' indicates no connection.
    0 1 2 3 4
0  0 1 0 1 0
1  1 0 1 0 0
2  0 1 0 1 0
3  1 0 1 0 1
4  0 0 0 1 0 
Adjacency List: An adjacency list represents each node and its neighbors.
a.	0: 1, 3
b.	1: 0, 2
c.	2: 1, 3
d.	3: 0, 2, 4
e.	4: 3
Cycles: A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same node, with no repeated edges or nodes in between.
There is only one cycle in this graph: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0
