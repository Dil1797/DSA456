                       LAB – 2 (Analysis Function)
              ==============================
Function 1 Analysis:
def function1(number):
    total = 0;
    for i in range(0, number):
        x = (i+1)
        total += (x*x)
    return total
Step 1: Establishing variables and functions
Let n = number (the input size).
The function initializes total = 0 and iterates n times.
Each iteration performs a few basic operations.
Step 2: Counting operations
total = 0 → 1 operation
for i in range(0, number): → n iterations
Inside the loop:
x = (i+1) → n operations
total += (x*x) → n operations
The return total statement is constant (O(1)).
Step 3: Establishing the Mathematical Expression for T(n)
Adding up all operations:
T(n) = 1+n+n+n+1 = 3n+2
Step 4: Simplifying the equation
The dominant term is O(n), so we simplify:
T(n)=O(n)

Function 2 Analysis:
def function2(number):
    return ((number)*(number+1)*(2*number + 1))/6
Step 1: Establishing variables and functions
Let n = number (input size).
The function directly returns a mathematical expression.
Step 2: Counting operations
The function executes a few arithmetic operations:
Multiplication: 3 operations → 
O(1)
Addition: 2 operations → 
O(1)
Division: 1 operation → 
O(1)
Since all of these are constant-time operations, they do not depend on n.
Step 3: Establishing the Mathematical Expression for T(n)
T(n)=O(1)
Step 4: Simplifying the equation
Since it's a constant number of operations, T(n) = O(1).
Function 3 Analysis (Bubble Sort):
def function3(list):
    for i in range(0, len(list) - 1):
        for j in range(0, len(list) - 1 - i):
            if list[j] > list[j + 1]:
                tmp = list[j]
                list[j] = list[j + 1]
                list[j + 1] = tmp
Step 1: Establishing variables and functions
Let n = len(list) (input size).
There are two nested loops, indicating quadratic complexity.
Step 2: Counting operations
Outer loop: runs n-1 times → O(n)
Inner loop: runs (n-1), (n-2), ..., 1 times → sum of first 
(n−1) integers.
Step 3: Establishing the Mathematical Expression for T(n)
T(n)= i=0∑n−1(n−1−i)
Using the sum formula:
𝑇(𝑛)=(𝑛−1)𝑛2
T(n)= 2(n−1)n

Step 4: Simplifying the equation
The dominant term is 𝑛222n 2, so we simplify:
T(n)=O(n2)

Function 4 Analysis:
def function4(number):
    total = 1
    for i in range(1, number):
        total *= (i+1)
    return total
Step 1: Establishing variables and functions
Let n = number (input size).
The function iterates from 1 to (number - 1).
Step 2: Counting operations
total = 1 → 1 operation
for i in range(1, number): → (n-1) iterations
Inside the loop:
total *= (i+1) → (n-1) multiplications
The return total statement is O(1).
Step 3: Establishing the Mathematical Expression for T(n)
T(n) = 1+(n−1)+(n−1)+1 = 2(n−1)+2
Step 4: Simplifying the equation
The dominant term is O(n), so we simplify:
T(n)=O(n)
